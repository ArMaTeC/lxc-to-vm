## [6.0.5] - 2025-02-25

### Fixed (CentOS/RHEL Support)

- **CPU type fix**: Added `--cpu host` to `qm create` for x86-64-v2 compatibility (CentOS 9 glibc requires x86-64-v2, not supported by default kvm64)
- **Initramfs drivers**: Added `sd_mod` and `ext4` to dracut `--add-drivers` so root block device is created properly
- **LXC artifact cleanup**: Remove LXC-specific systemd generators, container-getty services, and masked mount units that break VM boot
- **Library cache**: Run `ldconfig` before `dracut` so `libsystemd-core` is found and included in initramfs
- **Login prompt**: Enable `getty@tty1` and `serial-getty@ttyS0` services (containers use container-getty which doesn't work in VMs)
- **Guest agent**: Comment out restrictive `FILTER_RPC_ARGS` allow-list in CentOS qemu-ga config so `guest-exec` works

### Fixed (General)

- PowerShell 5.1 compatibility: Use `$psi.Arguments` string instead of `.ArgumentList` collection in `Invoke-ExternalCommandWithTimeout`
- CRLF stripping after SCP to remote host for bash script compatibility
